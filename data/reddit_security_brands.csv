É uma parada que eu sempre tive eu mente desde o Edgerunners e depois jogando e vendo a lore e como as pessoas vivem naquele universo me veio isso na mente. Mas eu não sou inteligente o bastante pra redigir um texto sobre o assunto, por isso eu perguntei a ao GPT sobre.












China como “Arasaka estatal” – Comparação Cyberpunk 2077

1. ARASAKA = Governo Chinês + gigantes estatais

Arasaka é:

nacionalista extrema

focada em segurança, espionagem, controle

mistura governo com empresa

prioridade total em poder e estabilidade

brutalmente secreta

coloca o lucro abaixo da hegemonia


Isso é exatamente a tríade:
PCCh (Partido) + Huawei + China State Security + empresas estatais de defesa.

Sem exagero, o modelo de “empresa que é Estado e Estado que opera como empresa” é 100% Arasaka.

Exemplos:

controle de dados de cidadãos → igual à Arasaka em NC

operações de espionagem industrial no exterior → manual Arasaka

empresas privadas obrigadas por lei a cooperar com o Estado → igual à divisão segurança da Arasaka



---

2. MILITECH = Exército chinês + indústria militar

Militech é domínio militar corporativo.

Na China:

o Exército (PLA) é parte do governo, mas funciona com orçamento corporativo, empresas próprias, pesquisa própria.

China investe em drones, IA militar, robôs de combate, veículos autônomos… somando mais que qualquer outro país exceto EUA.


O mais cyberpunk:

O PLA tem empresas subsidiárias que produzem desde chips até mísseis — exatamente como Militech lucrando com guerra e segurança.


---

3. BIOTECHNICA = Indústria biológica chinesa

Biotechnica é sobre:

edição genética

modificação biológica

biotecnologia de ponta

experimentos questionáveis

pesquisa sem ética ocidental


A China é o ÚNICO país que já permitiu (ilegalmente mas “tolerado”) bebês geneticamente editados com CRISPR.

Isso é nível corpo cyberpunk que faz experimento humano pra ver no que dá.

Além disso, lidera:

edição genética agrícola

clonagem animal

tratamento experimental não aprovado em outros países

fábricas de biopesquisa com nível de segurança dúbio


Biotechnica total.


---

4. KANG TAO = Setor de tecnologia e armas de energia

Kang Tao é chinesa no lore — e no mundo real, esse papel existe:

empresas chinesas desenvolvendo armas energéticas

drones de vigilância

robôs policiais

IA de reconhecimento de rosto

exportação de tecnologia militar pra regimes duvidosos


É literalmente a função de:

DJI

Hikvision

empresas de defesa chinesas mais “flexíveis”


Kang Tao é uma corp chinesa agressiva tentando quebrar o duopólio Arasaka/Militech — exatamente o papel da China vs EUA no mundo real.


---

5. ZetaTech / Zetatech = Setor de cybertech e IA

Empresas chinesas comandam hoje:

vigilância com IA

predição comportamental

identificação biométrica emergente

redes neurais dopadas com datasets que seriam ilegais no ocidente

robôs e automação massiva


A vibe é ZetaTech com mais orçamento e zero ética.


---

6. Petrochem = setor energético

Petrochem controla:

combustível

energia

infra global


Na China:

Sinopec

CNPC

State Grid


Essas empresas têm faturamento comparável às maiores do planeta e operam como corporações globais, mas com o poder coercitivo do Estado atrás.

Petrochem puro.


---

7. Trauma Team = sistemas de vigilância e saúde privatizada estatal

Trauma Team é “saúde como mercenário”.

Na China:

o setor médico virou hipermercado, com hospitais privados brutalmente competitivos

vigilância oculta na saúde

seguro saúde vinculado a comportamento social (crédito social)


É a versão realista do “se você pagar, mandamos um esquadrão armado te salvar”.


---

Resumo final

A China mapeia assim:

Cyberpunk Corp	Equivalente real na China

Arasaka	Governo + estatais + segurança + Huawei
Militech	Exército chinês + indústria militar
Biotechnica	setor de biotecnologia experimental
Kang Tao	armas energéticas, IA, drones
ZetaTech	IA, reconhecimento facial, robótica
Petrochem	gigantes de energia estatais
Trauma Team	sistema de saúde competitivo + vigilância

Hey, looking for some help from anyone familiar with Hikvision PTZs.

I’ve just installed two Hikvision DS-2DE4A425IWG-E PTZ cameras running on a Hikvision DS-7608NXI-K1/8P NVR.
The live view works fine and I can manually control the PTZ, but the Smart Tracking option is completely missing from both the NVR and the camera’s own web interface.

The weird part is this:
Last night it tracked my cat just fine, even without any bounding boxes showing
Today now that i’ve mounted it in my back garden I see no bounding boxes at all (no human detection boxes, no motion, nothing)
Still no Smart Tracking menu anywhere
The only thing I can find is Tracking Linkage under PTZ Smart Events such as intrusion detection etc. but I tried them and it didn’t work (these did work last night). 

Details:
	•	Camera model: DS-2DE4A425IWG-E
	•	Camera firmware: V5.7.12 build 230629
	•	NVR model: DS-7608NXI-K1/8P
	•	NVR firmware: V4.63.011 build 230720
	•	Smart Tracking does NOT appear under:
	•	PTZ → Smart Tracking
	•	Event → Smart Event
	•	Behavior Analysis
	•	Camera config (via Virtual Host)
	•	Virtual Host enabled
	•	PTZ movement works fine
	•	No detection boxes appear

Smart smoke detectors?
Doorbell can?

I have a rpi4 but just bought a mini pc which I’ll install Linux on, portainer for HA, matterbridge, and nvr software.

1. NVR DS-7608NXI-K1, milih ini karena kebutuhan 8 titik dan mau bisa komunikasi dua arah dari IPcamnya. Mungkin yang masih saya belum tau, kalau pakai ini, secara akses apakah tetap bisa via app Hikvision dan akses portforward? Dan apakah semua fiturnya neccessary diakses langsung via NVRnya atau bisa diconfig aja akses via browser? Kemudian saya lihat kalo di iklan tokped atau shopee ada statement seperti push notif, email, dan alarm ini setupnya akan seperti apa ya?
2. Beli switch DS-3E1510P-EI untuk sesuai kebutuhan 8 titiknya juga. 
3. Salah satu IPcam yang bakal dibeli adalah 2CD1027G2H-LIU, karena untuk komunikasi dua arahnya dan saya lihat ada fitur ColorVunya. Apakah ada alternatif lain yang lebih bagus atau lainnya? 
4. Untuk sisa IPcam lainnya, untuk indoor rencana DS-2CD1321G0-I karena kayanya udah bare minimum untuk kebutuhannya dan outdoor juga kurang lebih sama DS-2CD1021-I. Semua lensa sepertinya akan 2.8mm saja, biar wide angle. Apakah ada yang lebih baik lagi? Secara budget mungkin bisa maximum per IPCam 800rb. Atau cctv lain yang bisa on par dengan kemampuan NVRnya, soalnya saya liat NVR ini ada ""AI""-nya tapi juga butuh CCTV yang support.
5. Hardisk juga udah rencana standar cctv WD purple 4tb. Itu dengan on record 24/7 ada yang tau kira kira cycle recordnya bertahan bisa berapa lama ya?

This whole setup only cost me about 40 usd probably because I found most of the stuff in trash or because I  had it from a company's auction of used products. The most expensive one I have here is the orange pi. 

If you're wondering about the smart phone, it's an old Samsung galaxy grand prime 4g acting as a modem. It has a sim card(4g connection) on it and it's usb tethered to my orangepi and in the orange pi I run dnsmasq and nftables essentially making the orange pi a router.

The big router up on top is a fiber gpon router and it used to give me internet connection but not any more because I canceled the internet connection because it was so expensive but it still delivers voip. Instead of that I came up with the orange pi router and a 4g isp to make things cheaper. Things are slow with 4g but more  affordable.

In order to access the new internet connection I made via a smart phone I realized that I need wifi. So I looked up on aliexpress for wifi ap and the cheapest option was 5 usd. Ain't no way I am spending that much money. Instead I wondered about the old fiber router. It has a wifi ap and a gigabit switch on the lan side. I watched a video on YouTube and learned a trick which is disabling the local dhcp server on the fiber router to use it's lan ports as a switch for my orange pi router. So I did that. Now I have wifi and I got to use the gigabit switch available in the fiber router which will become handy later on.

Let's look at the mini pc I have over there. I acquired it from a friend who works for a company and I blurred out the name. It's running plex and I only managed to get a handful of movies to put in there. it has 256 gb nvme drive in it.  I store movies in there but if I keep doing that I am probably gonna max out the drive. I should invest in a nas but I merely can't because it's insanely expensive. But it also runs something more useful. I installed ffmpeg on it and I use it to record my ip camera to ram (/tmp) and later I use YouTube Data v3 api to upload the footage to a private Playlist on YouTube. All automated by a bash script running as a systemd service. The poe injector on the side of the power bar is the one that powers the ip camera.

You can see the small switch I have there it's from hikvision. That's where I hook up the 100 megabit devices (the ip camera, a samsung smart tv and a hikvision dvr). It costed me 0 usd as it was faulty and I repaired it.

But the orange pi and the mini pc can support a gigabit connection. That's where the gigabit switch from the gpon fiber router comes use full. I also save a bit of the ip camera's footage to the phone's internal storage. That's why I need the gigabit connection however I am not sure about the max speed of usb tethering at usb 2.0. I probably have to run iperf3 to test it out.


Let's talk about power. The phone is powered by a wall adaptor (4.2v) and not by the battery. The orange pi and the hikvision switch gets powered by a 5v adapter. The ups is a super old one. It's battery it's not the best it can give a run time of 30 minutes on a good day. But I only need it to survive short power outages and fluctuations. And the phones power button is wired to a relay and the relay is connected to the orange pi and I have adb over usb. So the orange pi can shut down or power on or do whatever it wants with the phone(cus the phone is rooted). With the click of a button in the orange pi it can shutdown the entire homelab or power it on.

Around the time of the last updates for the G5 Flex (could be a coincidence on timing) my camera feeds would drop out the whole 9 feeds would go black for a few-10 seconds. Then they would start to pop back up. The G5 flexes seem to do a full reboot as when they do this the image will appear upside down for second, and then the camera re-exposes. Physically at the camera you can hear the IR filter flick back and forth like they do when you first power them on. Sometimes some of the streams from the G5s come back first without doing the whole upside down image/start-up thing. 

The G3 feeds come back with none of those issues. The 1 Hikvision/Onvif feed comes back but takes a while. (Don't know if it just mine but ONVIF feeds always take a long time. Especially if you click on the frame to enlarge it could take 10 seconds or so before the feed goes live).

In the camera timeline sometimes protect will show camera has been offline for 6 seconds sometimes it doesn't (even though you know its gone down since it cycled the IR filter).

Has anyone else had this issue?

TL;DR

\-Recent issue. At least since last G5 flex firmware update

\-Camera feeds on viewer will all drop out randomly (sometimes once a day sometimes a couple times a day)

\-Image for G5 camera comes up upside down for a second and then camera re-exposes

\-G3 cameras come back as well as the ONVIF camera.

\-When it does go down itll be about 10 seconds or thereabouts before the streams pop back up.

Edit: Forgot to add the main switch powers most of the G5s. Also powers my U6-Pro which everyone else and all my Iot stuff is on. 2x G5s run off another POE switch as well as the 2x G3s. This switch is plugged into another port on the UDM.",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnifiProtect/comments/1oydxs6/unifi_protect_unvr_cameras_are_randomly_rebooting/,hikvision,"""hikvision"""

For some time now I've been happily using a single instance of Scrypted to view cameras across 2 different sites in HomeKit. One site has been running multiple HikVision cameras, the other an instance of Unifi Protect (+ multiple cameras).

It needed a VPN between the sites and some juggling with mDNS to get this running but it's been working really well using the 2 separate HikVision &amp; Unifi Scrypted plug-ins.

However the site running the HikVisions has just been upgraded to another Unifi Protect instance and now I'm a bit stumped as to how I can add this second instance to Scrypted. Is this at all possible?

I seem to be able to point the existing Unifi plugin at only one instance of Protect or another, not both. I get errors if I try to install a second instance of the Unifi plugin, so I'm guessing that's not going to work.

If I create a non-local (cloud) user which has access to all sites, would that work? And if so what IP address would I add to the Protect plug-in?

We’ve got some older sites that still have analog cameras running on ancient VMS software.

In total we’re talking 500+ cameras across a few locations.

Has anyone dealt with this before? Is there a way to leverage the multicast function and use the multicast IPs to bring in the other streams, or is that a dead end with Protect?

**Problem:**

In NX Witness when right-clicking the camera and goign to Camera-Rules - Add ""Analytics Object Detected"" -rule, can select the camera but cannot select ""Object Type"" The dropdown does not work so I suppose the system does not know that the camera can do smart detections.

I still have the Shelly relays.

I’d like a tablet for family control, maybe two, one portable and one wall mounted.

Smart smoke detectors?
Doorbell can?
Camera brand, is Reolink ok?

I have a rpi4 but just bought a mini pc which I’ll install Linux on, portainer for HA, matterbridge, and nvr software.

I’ll use the Shelly relays where I can (roller shutters, pool lights etc.

Yes, another ""which box shall I pick"" post.

Coming from a 5y old Intel NUC and having upgraded to 8 4k hikvision cameras I feel the need to upgrade it, it won't be just used to run frigate as I run a bunch of other Dockers and stuff so as overkill as it might sound, it won't be left running idle for sure

I'm really undecided about an Asus NUC 15 Pro Plus and a Beelink GTi115 Ultra.

They share the same Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and my question comes from reading other posts stating that the Beelink 14 iirc had some issues with frigate and I don't know about this one.

Price is really just the same from some EU vendor, so the question is also: is it worth to pick one rather than the other?

**This is a Super Early Post on What I've Observed so Far with Ubiquiti**

Where I started: Xfinity -&gt; Eero+Ring -&gt; Nest+Google -&gt;Synology Surveillance Station+ASUS-&gt; Ubiquiti

I am just jumping in on this ecosystem, not because ASUS is bad at networking and Synology Surveillance Station is bad at camera management, but it seems Ubiquiti has the most robust and fasting growing ecosystem without the compromise or tradeoffs of personal data. 

  
\-Ubiquiti is not good at storage (yet). If you are running a media streamer, Synology or similar is still the best. 

\-Ubiquiti's hardware and software looks and feels premium, the networking app is professional and robust - it really feels like enterprising networking (**I'm not a daily IT pro**). 

\-There is a sea of products, and it is somewhat of a maze and learning curve to put together your system (at least for me). 

\-I'm not a huge fan of the U7's pro's ceiling design, for a finished house I'm not willing to run lines to the ceiling (and I'm pretty extreme). I still need to circle back on incorporating these nodes into modern living design. 

\-I was previously on GT-B98's, and a pair of BQ16 pro's all wired backhauled and worked great, but with the UI and ecosystem of Ubiquiti, the comparison isn't even close - and you'll probably save money getting into the latter. 

**Cameras**

\-**Ubiquiti protect app for cameras is lightning  fast on load up**, 4k cameras and heavy streams have no issue just simply opening the app. I do use iPads with the screens on all day for camera viewing and there is no issue with the cameras freezing that forces a quit to reopen the app (this is a really big deal for me).

\-Ubiquiti will let you bring in your own 3rd party cameras - I use Hikvision cameras, and I've invested in some of their highest end LPR cameras. I'm even having one built on demand using their latest darkfighter 2 tech. This was all of course prior to me just jumping into Ubiquiti (bangs hand on keyboard). 

From what I've observed so far, if you have a 3rd party two camera system, like one for LPR and the other for regular viewing, I have yet to figure out how to get them both to display in the protect app. Where I liked Synology's Surveillance station is it had no issue with this, and it also had no issue with using the LPR (but you need to run a container and the cost of that yearly license is $350).

I have not used the AI module on this Hikvision 2 camera system yet, mostly because the LPR camera won't appear in the Protect app so I am unable to test it. This is one of my biggest issues so far. 

\-The AI module works well with my Hikvision ColorVU camera, but after viewing things over a short amount of time it completely misses motion and objects after 12am - I have not edited the camera native settings yet. 

**The takeaway is more advanced 3rd party cameras are not ready for prime time**. Will Ubiquiti open their system in the future to incorporate deep**er** 3rd party integration? 

\-I am still using Ring's door sensors and 24/7 monitoring only - I**'m just yearning for Ubiquiti expand in this area.** 

**Where I Still Need to Explore**

1. How good are Ubiquiti's native cameras, how good is LPR and do they provide a color view option at night? 

2. Frigate / Homekit Incorporation 

3. Doorbell, that G6.

4. AI home assistant functionality  - I want to be able to control my damn robot! - can't wait for the future on this.",26,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1ok5eks/just_getting_started_ubiquiti_is_great_so_far/,hikvision,"""hikvision camera"" OR ""hikvision cctv"""

Hi all,

I’m looking for some advice and real-world feedback from people who’ve moved from a Hikvision setup to UniFi Protect.

I’ve been running Hikvision for years but I’m getting increasingly frustrated, constant firmware issues, cameras being randomly discontinued with no long-term support (I have one that can’t be updated just two years after purchase), and even an NVR model that lost firmware support six months after release due to a chipset change during COVID. Add to that the never-ending bugs and unreliable mobile notifications, and I’ve had enough.

I was considering upgrading to one of Hikvision’s newer NVRs, but after setting up a UniFi Cloud Gateway and a few U7 Pro access points recently, I’ve been seriously impressed by UniFi’s software, it’s stable, intuitive, and a pleasure to use. So now I’m wondering if UniFi Protect offers the same level of polish and reliability.

Here’s my current setup:

* **NVR:** Hikvision DS-7608NXI-I2/8P **move to Unifi NVR**
* Existing Hikvision cameras to **move to AI Port:**
   * DS-2CD2H86G2-IZS (8MP)
   * DS-2CD2347G2-LU (4MP)
   * DS-2CD2342WD-I (4MP)
* **ONVIF** cameras to integrate **with Unifi NVR:**
   * DS-2CD2332-I (x3, 3MP each)

The plan is to use the ONVIF option for now, then gradually replace the cameras with UniFi models over time.

What I’d really like to hear from anyone who’s made the switch is:

* How does Protect compare to Hikvision from a functionality standpoint?
* How accurate and reliable are motion/person detections?
* What’s the delay (if any) between an event and a push notification?
* Are mobile notifications instant and consistent?
* Apart from the AI side, on the ONVIF integrations am I missing any other functionality?
* Any issues or limitations I should be aware of before committing?

reddit,1oj9az1,1oj9az1,_cybersecurity_,2025-10-29T17:32:31,"New HikvisionExploiter Tool Poses Serious Threat To Unpatched IP Cameras

**A new automated tool is targeting vulnerable Hikvision IP cameras, increasing risks of surveillance hijacking and data theft.**

**Key Points:**

- HikvisionExploiter automates attacks on outdated Hikvision IP cameras.
- The toolkit exploits a command injection flaw, CVE-2021-36260, allowing remote code execution.
- Thousands of Hikvision cameras remain exposed online, making them easy targets for attackers.

The HikvisionExploiter, a recently released open-source tool on GitHub, simplifies and automates the process of exploiting vulnerabilities in Hikvision IP cameras, particularly those running older firmware versions. Its primary function is to facilitate reconnaissance and exploitation of these devices, making it an invaluable resource for security researchers and red teamers. The tool can execute a series of checks to access vulnerable endpoints without authentication, allowing attackers to capture images and extract sensitive configuration data. Its incorporation of multithreaded scanning capabilities means that it can examine numerous targets simultaneously, highlighting the ease with which attackers can identify and compromise unprotected devices.

At the core of the HikvisionExploiter is the critical command injection vulnerability, CVE-2021-36260, which has been a persistent threat since its discovery in 2021. This flaw permits unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands on vulnerable devices, making it a significant vector for potential exploits. As highlighted by recent observations, attackers have developed new methods to exploit this weakness, further underscoring the urgency for users to update their firmware and adopt best practices for securing their networked devices. Given the ongoing presence of unpatched Hikvision cameras online, the risks associated with these vulnerabilities could lead to serious consequences like unauthorized surveillance and data breaches.

What measures do you think organizations should implement to safeguard against such vulnerabilities in their IP camera systems?

Hi all, 

I've been doing some research, my BlueIris renewal is up again for support/software updates which means I'm looking around for alternatives - I've been watching Frigate for the last year and a bit and I just wanted to ask some questions as I can't seem to find any answers as to whether it will work for me yet or not 

I'm looking to completely replace BI as I currently have it running as a Windows VM for obvious reasons. If I can ditch that VM, I can release my GPU into unraid for containers to use 

My primary concern is 24/7 recording of sub streams with full quality for events - Is this something that I can get Frigate to support at the moment? 

Secondly, How compatible is H265 cameras with audio streaming? I've downloaded Frigate and had a quick play but I can't seem to get both audio and video streams happening on my Hikvision cameras (currently configured to H265). I managed to get video with no audio, and then audio with no video when viewing on iOS devices. 

  
Is Frigate in a state yet that I can use it as a drop in replacement for a NVR such as BlueIris or should I wait a little longer? I understand that the config is all YAML which isn't a terrible object to overcome and from the last few days of reading the subreddit here the community seems very helpful, so I'm not too concerned. I just want to make sure that Frigate can support what I want to do before I put more hours into getting it configured 

I intend to run Frigate through Unraid, CPU is a 12600 with 64GB of RAM. GPU is a RTX 2070 Super. Currently have 8 Cameras, all Hikvision, all 4K, 6 of which have audio. I would like the ability to further extend this with another 6-7 cameras in the future.

Maybe someone here has some insight...

I'm installing cameras (50) and an NVR (3xLogic, Windows-based) on a site. The site's IT has provided me a pair of Meraki switches on their network (exact models unknown at the moment; I can find out if that info will help). Most of the cameras are plugged into switch 1; a few cameras and the NVR are plugged into switch 2.

When I run the camera finder (Dahua ConfigTool) on the NVR, it sees all the cameras on both switches, but it won't let me edit IPs for cameras on the ""other"" switch - ie. with the NVR on switch 2, the finder sees all cameras, but I can only change IPs of those on switch 2; if I plug the NVR into switch 1, it again sees all cameras, but I can only edit the IPs for cameras on switch 1.

When I run the ""Detect Cameras"" tool on the NVR, it (using ONVIF) only sees the cameras on the same switch as the NVR.

When I run the generic ONVIF Device Manager tool, it too only sees the cameras connected to the same switch.

HOWEVER, I can still access ANY camera's web interface... I can issue CGI commands (using http/https) from the finder... I can activate them... all the other options in the config program work (batch setting of time zone, time sync, video standard, video parameters, etc. etc.).. pretty much everything except editing their IPs.

The IT guy originally stacked the switches... then on the chance it was a bad stacking cable and for the sake of troubleshooting, connected them via 10Gbps cables on the GBIC ports instead (yes, removed the stacking cable and deleted the stack)... and even just connected them directly between copper ports with good ol' Cat6 patch cables. Same thing no matter what.

He even spent time on the phone with Meraki troubleshooting the issue, to no avail. Their solution ultimately was to offer to RMA both switches... so now we're waiting on that. Meanwhile, more cameras are still being installed and the way it is now, I'm going to have to edit IPs on each one manually, directly in the web interface (doable, but very tedious).

It seems something is blocking something very specific from transitioning between the two switches... ARP packets maybe? IT set the interconnect ports as trunk ports, even turned off all VLAN filtering... still no go. I've done dozens of sites for this client, many with a similar setup, with no problems.

UPDATE: As of yesterday, the ONVIF tool on the NVR doesn't see ANY of the cameras regardless of the switch they're on. The camera finder itself sees the cameras, and I can change any parameters that it supports, EXCEPT the IP (including changing the setting to DHCP). The ONVIF-based ""detect camera"" function in the NVR also doesn't see any cameras (where previously it at least saw the ones on the same switch as the NVR).

I can still log into the cameras' web interfaces, still change the network settings from there, but not from within the finder. The NVR is still pulling a stream from the cameras just fine. 

At the same time, the same issue popped up on another new site with Meraki switches, as well as at least two existing sites.

On those two existing sites, the ONVIF tool sees cameras connected to a non-Meraki switch (an older Cisco SG300) that the NVR is plugged into, but doesn't see any cameras connected to a downlinked Meraki switch. 

Again, ConfigTool sees ALL the cameras, and lets me edit the IPs of cameras on the Cisco switch, but fails when I try to edit the IPs of those on the Meraki.

The one site also has about half Hikvision cameras, and they see exactly the same issue: SADP Tool finds all cameras, and I can edit the IP of cameras on the Cisco, but it fails for the ones on the Meraki.

I'm trying to see if a site has a Meraki switch as the primary and another switch of another brand downstream of that, to see if the cameras on that other switch are still fully accessible, or if the Meraki is blocking access to them as well. So far, it's really pointing to something with the Merakis... either a recent firmware update has broken something on all of them, or the client has made some change network-wide that's causing it.",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1ohuwn0/blocked_data_between_switches/,hikvision,"""hikvision camera"" OR ""hikvision cctv"""

Hello all. I've read many posts on this subreddit and other places, but still I have some doubts about mixing Hikvision and Ubiquiti for home. 

**TLDR**:

My current (temporary only) setup is as follows:

LTE modem to which connected is the Hikvsion nvr with 4 Hik cameras connected to it via POE. I can access the cameras remotely using HikVision app also I'm receiving push notifications on my mobile when motion is detected. I have also Tech doorbell that I can access remotely using Tuya app.

In the near future I plan to build my home network with Ubiquiti hardware, but I don't want to get rid off already purchased Hik and Tech staff (even if that would prbly be the best option). I plan to buy UCG Fiber and USW Pro Max 16 POE as the main switch to which I'll connect AP's and prbly also 1 or 2 Flex switches, maybe later on also UNAS. 

I want to separate my network with couple of VLANs and here is the place where my doubts came in. 

I know that ideally I should get rid off any P2P, especially for cameras and nvr. So I plan to create separate VLAN for NVR and cameras and maybe the doorbell and limit the internet access. But I have some doubts on how to configure this securely, what I'm thinking of is either:

* connect only Hikvision nvr to the USW and leave cameras connected to the nvr, create separate VLAN and assign the port to which nvr is connected to it.
* connect Hikvision nvr and cameras directly to the USW, create separate VLAN for cameras and second one for nvr only and allow inter-vlan routing between them.

Similarly with doorbell (but unfortunately it's connected over WiFI). 

But in both cases - how can I setup the mobile push notifications? This part in unclear to me. Should I somehow use Unifi Protect (as it supports now 3rd party cameras)?

Additional question is - I would like also to secure the remote access to the cameras by using the VPN only - which one would be best? Teleport, WireGuard, Proton? Something else?

While troubleshooting this issue, I have plugged the WiFi AP in to port 10 and a laptop running Wireshark in to port 11.  Both the WiFi AP and the laptop get a DHCP address from the FW just fine but the camera will not.  Using Wireshark, I watch for DHCP packets going to the 2 port channel interfaces (Ge1 and Ge2) while plugging in the camera and the WiFi AP.  What I see in Wireshark is the following packets coming from the WiFi AP:

&gt;4052 978.108280    [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0)[255.255.255.255](http://255.255.255.255)DHCP    516 DHCP Discover (No 802.1Q Tag)  
4053 978.108280    [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0)[255.255.255.255](http://255.255.255.255)DHCP    520 DHCP Discover (With 802.1Q Tag)

4057 978.131352    [10.7.1.254](http://10.7.1.254)[10.7.1.101](http://10.7.1.101)DHCP    347 DHCP ACK

There are no packets reaching the firewall from the camera.  If I restart the monitoring and add port 9 (the port the camera is connected to) to the session then, I see the following coming from the camera:

&gt;274 68.643379    [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0)[255.255.255.255](http://255.255.255.255)DHCP    516 DHCP Discover (No 802.1Q Tag)  
280 70.973466    [0.0.0.0](http://0.0.0.0)[255.255.255.255](http://255.255.255.255)DHCP    520 DHCP Discover (No 802.1Q Tag)

Obviously these aren't reaching the firewall because they're not tagged with the correct VLAN ID.

I can't see why my AP and my laptop have no problem getting a DHCP address but the camera can't?

  
UPDATE:

It seems there was a stuck DHCP offer that was never accepted on the PA FW's DHCP server for this camera.  Clearing the DHCP leases removed the offer and everything came up ok after plugging the camera back in.  I'm still unclear how the untagged packets would get to the firewall though.",0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1o341nr/dhcp_not_working_for_hikvision_camera_on_cisco/,hikvision,"""hikvision camera"" OR ""hikvision cctv"""

Hi there, I am a system administrator looking to pick up a new NVR for a home lab.  Currently I use Hikvision and have four hikvision cameras around my house. They're on a isolated VLAN with no internet access. 

That being said, I'm looking for a good NVR, a hardware device, because running a virtual machine makes it part of my lab and I want a trouble free hands off system.

My current Hikvision is so old it requires IE, so something that uses HTML5 would be good.  If needed I can keep it isolated on a vlan because i'm smart enough to do that, but at the same time i would prefer not to have to.

In fact I would love to find a NVR that has hardware that maybe people are working a open source firmware for or such?  That being said I would strongly prefer for it to keep my same cameras if possible. 

I very much want the multi-view over a HDMI since i use Crestron stuff to distribute that multi-view around the house.

I work from home and my office is in a room with no view, so I use the security cameras on a TV to make me a window to the outside. I plant to put a PTZ camera on my roof just for fun (Maybe some day i'd like to program it to auto-aim at planes) but a system that could support a external joystick for camera movements could be awesome too.

So, Anyone with enough expertise to suggest a system?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/securitycameras/comments/1o2b2bs/nvr_shopping/,hikvision,"""hikvision camera"" OR ""hikvision cctv"""

Posting this as when I was thinking about it  I couldnt find many reviews so hope it helps someone.

  
Ive been with sky 20 odd years and always had the latest and greatest tech and they were always at the forefront of innovation. but I had a falling out over their inability to fix a broadband issue.

  
My initial concerns were how good linear TV be, especially flcking between channels, would I miss recording and would I miss 4K? Finally we have a mini sky box in the kitchen. The EE TV box promise a like for like replacement but I fancied a little experiment and also figured the apple TV would be better hardware.

  
Account setup is a little fiddly with various accounts for different TV providers but I daresay if you are reading this you'll manage. One advantage is I can watch nowtv (sky) over the web without the bloody awful sky go app!

I had Sky Q&gt;HDMI&gt;TV&gt;HDMI ARC&gt;Amp and the Apple tv literally took its place and pretty much just worked, remote for volume and so on. I can't get the amp to turn off, not sure if I could with sky as I used a logitech universal remote.

The remote control supplied is a little different to the apple device and all the better for it.

EETV app is pretty decent, switching between channels maybe take a smidge more than sky q but thats being really picky. The EPG isn't quite as slick as Sky's but I can live with it.

 I found jumping between 'EE TV' and the normal apple function a little fiddly, it's a bit like if you have carplay jumping between that and the native car apps

  
Picture quality is good, my failing eyesight doesnt miss 4K probably helped by the fact I have it cabled in, and the EE broadband always goes over 900Mbit on speedtests even at peak periods

Lack of recordings hasn't been an issue so far, with so much on demand. And of course apple tv is great for the streaming apps. I had to disable HDR as the scenes in disney TV were very dark.

  
There's has been a few unexpected benefits of apple tv device. Steam player allows streaming from the PC with no appreciable latency that my son has used for gaming;. I struggled to find a similar app to project my laptop till I realsed steamplayer does an excellent job of that too.

With a little bit of geeky fiddling I am also able to show my hikvision cctv via apple home and have it PIP

For the kitchen I was planning on buying a firestick but with a firestick costing 50quid and a new smart tv 100, I opted for the latter and that has enough to meet the need in there.  


So, overall very happy. I'm paying alot less than sky and it's more than acceptable and in some respects can do things I've never been able to before.",10,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EEGB/comments/1nsm36e/switching_from_sky_q_to_ee_tv_with_apple_tv_a_few/,hikvision,"""hikvision camera"" OR ""hikvision cctv"""

That is connected to an old 10/100 16 port switch in the attic, which then goes down to all the rooms around the house - as well as to a couple of Unifi APs and some Hikvision Cameras. All cabling is cat5e.

My plan is to replace the router with a Ubiquiti UDM Special Edition (UDM-SE) and replace the switch in the attic with a Ubiquiti USW-16-POE PoE+ Gen2 Switch. I want 1gb networking.

reddit,1nq2srx,1nq2srx,_cybersecurity_,2025-09-25T12:07:49,"Hackers Target Hikvision Cameras to Access Your Data

**A critical vulnerability in Hikvision cameras is being exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.**

**Key Points:**

- CVE-2017-7921 vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Attackers are using brute-force tactics on devices with weak passwords.
- Hikvision firmware patches exist, but many devices remain unpatched.
- Exploited cameras can be used to launch further attacks on networks.

The cybersecurity landscape is facing a significant threat as hackers actively exploit a vulnerability in Hikvision security cameras, identified as CVE-2017-7921. This flaw, which has a critical severity score of 10.0, permits remote, unauthenticated attackers to bypass security measures and gain control over affected devices. The process involves sending crafted web requests that can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, including user credentials stored in the configuration files of the cameras. Many of these files use weak encryption, enabling attackers to decrypt and harvest sensitive data easily.

Despite Hikvision's release of firmware updates to mitigate this vulnerability, a large number of devices continue to operate on outdated versions, remaining exposed to attacks. The problem is exacerbated by the prevalence of rebranding in the industry, where numerous manufacturers market these vulnerable cameras under different names, complicating efforts for users to secure their devices. The risks associated with a successful breach extend beyond mere data theft; attackers can view live video feeds and leverage compromised cameras to infiltrate internal networks, escalating the potential for further malicious activity.

What steps are you taking to secure your security cameras from similar vulnerabilities?

Hello everyone,

I've had a strange problem with several Hikvision cameras that has happened over time. The cameras have been working for years without any issues with their original POE injector (802.3af), but from one day to the next, they stop turning on.

I've checked the following:

* The POE injector works perfectly, as when I connect another identical camera (or even a different model), it powers on without any issues.
* The network cable is in good condition.
* When I connect the camera that ""failed"" to a more powerful POE (802.3at or PoE+), it turns on and works without any problems.

It's as if the camera suddenly decides that the original POE is no longer sufficient and now needs more power. The camera's nominal power consumption is the same, but for some reason, it demands more energy to boot up.

Has anyone else experienced this behavior with Hikvision cameras? Do you know why this happens and if there's a solution other than buying a more powerful POE for every camera that ""fails""?

This is a follow-up regarding the issue you were facing with your UNVR instant showing a black screen. To assist you further, could you please try the following steps to help get the ONVIF cameras working:

* **Ensure the sub-stream (Low Quality stream) is enabled** on the camera. ViewPort relies on this stream for decoding, especially when multiple cameras are viewed at once.  
* **Re-adopt the camera in the UniFi Protect web interface** after enabling the LQ stream. This ensures Protect properly detects both HQ and LQ streams.  
* **Avoid HQ-only stream configurations.** While these may work fine in the Protect web UI, ViewPort may not be able to render them without an LQ fallback.  
* **If needed, please test with a single ONVIF camera** assigned to a View to see if it appears correctly after re-adoption.

The next tier asked me to try showing a view with a single camera. From what I understand, a single view will use the main stream (not a substream) so they were curious if that work would. If not, they asked for another support file export and they would be escalating to their development team.

I will keep updating this thread as I get responses.

\-- Update: Oct 10,2025 --

I have been escalated to the development team. No further instructions yet.

  
\-- Update: Oct 23,2025 --

Success! The development team remoted into my UNVR Instant (I provided them access) and applied custom firmware. I was required to set my cameras ""Stream Compatibility Mode"" to ""Improved"".

We have a white box ""NVR"" product currently.  It works, but I don't trust it to be on our network.  It's about time we move to something more robust.  I use UI products at home but none of their Camera line of equipment.  

Our current setup is 18 Cameras, White box Hikvision stuff.  

I'm thinking of getting the NVR Pro, and a handful of UI cameras for some of the new camera locations we want and then slowly adopting or replacing the existing cameras over to the NVR Pro.  I have no problem maxing out the disk capacity with drives.

Couple questions:

1. I believe I read you can stack up to 3 NVR Pro units and see all cameras via a single console?  It may be a bit before we get there, but we have several locations that they will want cameras at and I could see us adding a second NVR Pro or more in the future.

2. How many users can realistically be logged in and watching video?  Right now we have probably 6 in our customer service group that would want eyes on 2 cameras, 3 in our shipping/receiving that would want to watch maybe 2 cameras, 1 large screen viewing station with multiple cameras, 1 full time viewing station of a group of 3 cameras.  I know some systems struggle with that many users logged in and rendering all of that video.  Just curious if this will even be possible.

3. I know there are limitations to bringing in these Hikvision cameras, but other than some feature loss, we should have no problem just recording the stream, correct?

Super interested in getting over to a new camera system.  The current one is less than optimal.

I had a professional installer install 20 Hikvision cameras across multiple switches (spread out over a few sheds), a few years ago now.  These are all on 192.168.100.xx

The NVR (DS-7732NI-M4 / 16P) is at 192.168.100.200

There are only 2 cameras on the office building where the NVR is and he plugged them straight into the NVR - but these are in the IP range 192.168.254.xx

I'm wanting to display these two cameras in my Homeassistant system (also on 192.168.100.xx), but they don't seem to want to work, I assume as they are on a different subnet, so I'm trying to find out how to change them to the main subnet.

In iVMS-4200 I can see a setting for ""PoE Network Card Settings"" - ""Internal network card IPv4 address"" which is set at 192.168.254.1.

I can configure the two local NVR cameras at 192.168.100.200:65001 and :65002 

Can I:

1. change the Ip address to a free address at 192.168.100.xx on the cameras?
2. Change the ""PoE Network Card Settings"" - ""Internal network card IPv4 address"" to 192.168.100.xx (another free address)?

I could probably reconfigure the main office switch and plug the cameras into that (after changing their IP addresses), it just seems I'd be wasting the 16 port switch on the NVR and my office switch is already full, I'd have to put another small switch in.

EDIT:  I ended up adding an old non-managed non-poe 5 port switch and moving some devices to that, then plugging the 2 cameras directly into the main switch (with a camera vlan).

This took far longer than it should have - when changing the IP address, on clicking save the Hikvision software prompts you to reboot now - seemed reasonable so I did that.  New IP addresses would not stick.  You have to say no to the reboot, save it, then reboot (or power cycle by moving the cable to the new switch as I did).

Hi All,

I'm looking to get a Alarm and CCTV system installed in my home and from the quotes I've received when reaching out to installers in my area (Australia) - it seems like Hikvision has generally been recommended.

I understand there's some issues with security/privacy associated with Hikvision but I'm completely new to home networking so hoping I could get some answers to (potentially dumb) questions:

1. The proposed CCTV system the installer will provide includes some Hikvision/Hi-Look Cameras (T361H-MU) and a 4 channel NVR (NVR-104MH-C). What additional equipment do I need to separate the above from my home network? (Is there a dummies guide on how to do this out there somewhere?)
2. Would the alarm system also have similar security/privacy concerns or are they okay to be connected to my wifi/local network?
3. If I don't go with Hikvision - what are some recommended brands that have less security/privacy concerns? For the alarm system I'm seeing Paradox Magellan Hybrid Alarm or Bosch 3000/6000 as an available option - any thoughts on those systems?. Not sure about the CCTV camera alternatives though.

I'm moving from Axxonnext, as they made it impossible for Joe Average to have their software.  
  
I figured I'd try Agent DVR and I have it configured generally to my liking. Just one issue. It doesn't ""Detect"" as often as it should. If I walk into my garage, it sees me. If I take the same path, it consistently doesn't see me. If I drive my car into the garage, its sees it.  If I drive my car out of the garage, it doesn't see it. I've tried to make detection super sensitive and it just doesn't see anything leaving the garage.  To get even stranger, two cameras see my garage and both have see things go into it, neither sees things come out of it. All Detections are filter through Project AI AI object recognition (YOLOv5, full precision, large model) before recording, so I'd much prefer a false positive Detection.  
  
Example configuration for a hikvision camera, where I use a 2688x1520 stream:  
Detector: Simple  
Sensitivity: 5-100  
Gain: 40 (Gain confuses me a little. Defaults to 10, but AI says it's a multiplier of a default of 1).  
Analyzer: CNT (only choice available)  
Frame size: Medium (have tried large)  
Max Object: 3  
Detect Interval: 100  
Track Interval: 100  
Pixel Stability: 1-40  
Tracking Timeout: 3  
Movement Timeout: 3  
  
It's triggering like crazy on bugs, but will miss my car leaving the garage.   
  
I still have Axxonnext running on a less powerful machine (that I want to shut down forever), it doesn't have this issue. As a sanity check, I installed the trial version of [Blue Iris](https://store.ipcamtalk.com/shop/blue-iris-software/) in a less powerful VM and it doesn't have this problem (also talking wiht CodeProject.ai).

I'm completely new to IP cameras. I literally didn't know a thing about them before a week ago, and my biggest difficulty that no one seems to answer is which camera companies allow you setup and access your camera without their proprietary app? This seems like an odd omission in any security system setup. I would like a camera to be locked down via some basic web interface at setup, ensuring the camera is configured for what I want at that time or perhaps is configurable via Frigate later as well.

After everything I've been reading and looking at what's available in my area, I'm leaning towards EmpireTech, which I believe is the same as Amcrest and Duaha (sp). People seem to be less keen on Reolink, TP Link, Ubiquity, etc.... It's not that they're necessarily bad, but I get the strong sense these companies push you hard to use their ecosystem, and I'm wanting something that relies less on a particular NVR to run my cameras. I also don't want to work with a company that requires some kind of online management or data sharing. These cameras will be strictly offline.

If people are curious on the hardware I've likely going to use, I've opted for an MSI Cubi NUC 1M with Core i7-150U and comes with 2 2.5GB ethernet ports.

I'm unsure if I'll need a Coral, as the IRIS gpu may be sufficient for my initial intended setup. But my main concern is to figure out which camera companies make this setup easy and without sharing my private data with them.

My Questions:

1. Which camera companies allow configuration of their cameras without a proprietary app?

2. When selecting a camera, what is better suited for a room? a 2.8mm or 3.6mm? I'm open to changing my ideas here, but the EmpireTech 4MP S2 and S3 both seem good, but the S3 seems overkill for a room. I believe the S3 is one of the recommended frigate cameras.

I'm equally open to HIKVISION cameras, but the one that looks best for a room (a lower end one) is rated 3.8 on Amazon.

I want to fully switch to all Unifi protect cameras but I wanted to test it first so I bought a g6 bullet and Ai protect.  I have a UDM pro.

But for now, let me talk about the g6 first.

I replaced a hikvision camera with the g6 bullet for my long driveway.  The Hik was on corridor/hallway mode used in Frigate.  It was detecting pretty OK and wanted it to be good which is why I bought Unifi because of the good things Ive heard.

Installed the g6 bullet in the exact same spot and also did hallway/corridor mode.  

Love the daytime images!  I also tested in full daylight with the sun point perfectly to the driveway.

So I set some alarms and even have my wife walk the driveway so I can see realtime what protect is seeing.

To my surprise, the motion or AI detection (people/face) is not good at all.  She had to be really close to the camera before she was identified.  The weird thing too is only face is detected and not a person.  I would assume a person should be detected first then associate a face to it. Person detection will only be identified if she is very very close to the camera.

My frigate would have detected her 10-15 more feet further.

So what I did is enabled the rtsps of my G6 bullet and added it to my frigate instance and yup, the detection became way better .. so I know it is not the camera. Like I mentioned, daylight images are good and super clear.

Just to add, it detects a plate number superbly.  Like my car is very far from the driveway and it picks it up while driving in.  So I know the g6 bullet can detect fine!

I've tried playing around with the zones and tried 1, tried 2, and more zones to no help.  Even set the sensitivity to 100%.  Tried playing around with FPS and/or image qualities and didnt help.

Now for the AI protect, I paired it with a hikvision camera that is indoor (poe) and Im experiencing the same thing with detection, it seems to be missing a lot vs the same camera on frigate.  Lets say my frigate detected 15 cats .. ai protect only detected 5.

Now, forget about night detection as it is way worse.  Although the frigate struggles too.


Edit: will an AI pro be a better buy because of the optical zoom?  Does protect use the optical lense for detection on the ai pro?

Is it because of the hallway mode?

What tweaks do you typically do to improve detection as I really really want to keep this and fully switch!

Hello all.

I have a Dahua NVR with 2 Dahua Camera's. Everything works perfectly and I thought to add an Dahua VTO. It was a pain to get it to initialize but I managed. But now, the VTO just shows up as a normal camera in the DMSS app. What's also strange that the device name in the DMSS app is not VTO anymore but something like NVR4. I'm totally at a loss here. Is the VTO not to be a stand alone doorbell if I plug it in over POE on the NVR?

I'm using a Dahua camera (specifically a DH-IPC-HDW2849TM-S-IL) with Frigate. It works really well except that the time on the time-stamp drifts over time (and does not change for DST).



The NTP time-server (System-&gt;General-&gt;Date&amp;Time) does NOT work for me, perhaps because I've disabled the P2P (Network-&gt;Access Platform -&gt; P2P) so it doesn't call home?



To fix this I wrote a python script (below) to set the camera time. It's a bit complex since it has to login with a challenge-response, but once that's done it just POSTs to an endpoint on the camera with the new time.



I've set this to run every day via cron...



I know I could use frigate/ffmpeg to add a time stamp but the encoding/decoding feels like a heavy lift...

I swear, Dahua needs to hire someone who actually understands how time synchronization works. Their DST and manual time settings are absolute garbage.

Every year — without fail — half my cameras update to the new time, and the other half just sit there stuck in the past (literally). Sometimes they randomly change time zones, sometimes they refuse to sync even after forcing a manual update, and even a full reboot doesn’t fix it.

I’ve tried:
	•	Enabling automatic DST — doesn’t work.
	•	Setting the timezone manually — inconsistent results.
	•	Rebooting NVR and cameras — still chaos.
	•	NTP sync — works for a while, then suddenly jumps an hour off.

It’s 2025. Every other cheap IoT device can handle DST correctly, but apparently, Dahua decided that implementing basic time logic is optional.

Anyone else dealing with this nonsense? Is there any reliable way to force consistent time across Dahua cameras and NVRs?

Installing cameras is well within my comfort zone and skillset. Networking and setup is my weak spot but as this is for my place I'm happy to work my way through any problems.

I've already installed a doorbell and indoor monitor through a network switch. I'm looking at an NVR and camera combo from the same manufacturer and wasn't sure on configuration.

I asked an LLM what size NVR would be needed for the existing doorbell, monitor and 4 cameras. This seems right to me but if anyone spots an error I'd appreciate help.



# Do the VTO (doorbell) and VTH (indoor monitor) need NVR camera channels?

* **VTO (doorbell station):**
   * Can be added to the NVR as a camera channel if you want its video recorded.
   * But it does **not need** an NVR PoE port to work as an intercom — it just needs network (via PoE switch or router).
   * If you don’t care about recording, don’t waste a channel.
* **VTH (indoor monitor):**
   * Never takes up an NVR channel.
   * It’s a SIP client device that talks directly to the VTO and the app.
   * It just needs a network connection (PoE or Wi-Fi).

# So in your case:

* With an **8-channel NVR** you’ll have:
   * 4x IP cameras (CCTV) → 4 channels used
   * 1x VTO (if you want it recorded) → 1 channel used
   * Leaves 3 spare camera channels
* The **VTH does not count** toward those 8 channels.

# Best practice wiring

* Plug your 4 CCTV cameras + VTO into the NVR’s built-in PoE ports (or an external PoE switch if you prefer).
* The VTH just needs PoE or Wi-Fi back to the same LAN — it doesn’t go into the NVR at all.

👉 So yes, your assumption is right: with an **8-channel NVR you’ll comfortably run 4 CCTV cameras + the existing doorbell system** (recording its video if you want). The indoor monitor doesn’t take up NVR capacity.

  
So with all this time I've wasted, I probably should have just found a CCTV sub and asked there instead of trying the LLM but here we are.

Hey folks, I’ve been working on the next iteration of my home network and made a diagram (hope it's understandable). There are a few things I’m not 100% sure about and need some advice on:

1. Specs for the Proxmox machine: CPU/RAM recommendations for this workload, and storage (Frigate should be okay with 1TB, media server needs more but I won’t fill it completely). Can I get away with a Mini PC and extend storage externally? Also, I have an old WD EX2, I'm open to using it if there are any ideas on repurposing it without using its stock UI

2. How can I have Pi-hole (in a VM) act as DNS for the whole network (all VLANs)? In my current network it's running baremetal on a RPi 3b+ connected to an ASUS router, which is a simpler configuration.

3. Which services should run as containers and which as VMs, and which VLAN each should live on?

4. I'll be using Dahua cameras and NVR. You may wonder why I'm using Dahua NVR while there's Frigate there already? The reason is to give my non-tech-savvy family access to the cameras when they're out and need to keep an eye back home. If I had to set something up for myself, I'd probably consider tailscale or something to access frigate directly.

5. What’s the easiest way to make a folder accessible on the LAN (isolated from internet) from the Proxmox box? Not looking to set up a full blown NAS, just want access to a network shared folder from my home devices, and maybe also access to the arr stack download folders.

Most importantly, am I making any errors here? What can be improved? I wanted to be sure that this is an okay start since it will consume time and resources to set this up.

i have an installation of 36 cameras at my home+business (same building), both indoor and outdoor. they are analog cameras hooked up to DVRs. I would like to upgrade to better resolution cameras and also the features offered by the latest generation of Digital + NVR - like motion and event detection, face recognition etc.

I am considering Frigate for this. A quick AI chat suggested that frigate is better for smaller installations and that zoneminder might be a better option, but said frigate had better community support (must have for a noob like me) and tighter integration with homeassistant (nice to have for the near future upgrades i am planning).

Questions:

1. is frigate a good option for this volume of cameras (36 and might increase to as much as 45-50)?
2. what sort of hardware will i need? i don't plan on having a separate NVR device. i have an HPZ420 that i would like to put to use if that is feasible.
3. if that is overkill, i also have a Dell Wyse N07D 5060 Thin Client G GX-424CC 2.4GHz + 4GB RAM. will the Dell be sufficient?
4. i am open to installing the coral TPU for detection acceleration. will i need it? if so, is coral still the recommended hardware?
5. i'm thinking dahua cameras based on recommendation of frigate website. is this still the community favourite? if not, what is? i'm looking for something easy on the pocket as this already is an expensive upgrade for me.
6. that said about the cost, i don't want this installation breaking on me all the time, so while cost IS a factor, i don't want it to be at the expense of reliability. i want to set it and forget it for let's say 5 years.

i realize that's a bunch of questions, so thank you all in advance for any or all advice!",12,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/frigate_nvr/comments/1mczrpg/can_frigate_handle_36_cameras_hardware_advice/,dahua,"""dahua camera"" OR ""dahua cctv"""

**Hello everyone!**  
  
I'm looking to upgrade my current Dahua NVR system and would really appreciate your input. I’d like to add an exterior camera to cover the outside of my local market, and also replace the existing camera monitoring the counter with a high-end model. Ideally, the new counter camera should offer crystal clear image ( when i playback the video to still keep the high quality when i zoom in — I need to clearly see the banknotes when they’re  handed over by customers ) we already have a decent camera for that on the ceiling that we got a few years ago but would like to upgrade if there's something noticeably better.  
  
For the exterior camera, I’m aiming for something reliable and high-quality. If it has built-in lights or features that can help deter thieves or burglars at night, that would be a huge bonus.  
  
I’ve spoken to a few security camera vendors in my area, but it feels like they’re just trying to push what they have in stock. So I’d much rather hear real recommendations from you guys.  
  
Also, I’d like to install two additional cameras on my house for personal security and to monitor the surroundings when I’m not home. Since the market is located at my house's ground floor, I can connect them directly to the market's NVR also.

Memo: Car

Contains: IsInside=""true""
Node path: Source/SimpleItem

Memo: Person

That does work, but it would be more precise to use an XPath query like: /tt:Message[tt:Source/tt:SimpleItem[@Rule=""Car""] and tt:Data/tt:SimpleItem[@IsInside=""true""]]

That xpath doesn't match in BlueIris (but does with ""real"" xpath matching). The docs are not very clear about the format of the paths.

Last year I picked up some Dahua cameras with the plan to set up some monitoring on our farm, there's been a spate of farm thefts locally in recent years. Life got in the way and I've only recently started looking at it again. As I run some simple Home Assistant stuff, I investigated Frigate but that would need new hardware for the processing and several hundred quid spent on a new mini PC &amp; Coral. Blue Iris would need a separate NVR.

I run a unifi networking setup with a UDMPro, 24 port poe switch and a bunch of access points (250 year old house with 60cm solid stone walls) and started considering Unify Protect as being a simple way to add cameras. Now that Protect accepts onvif cameras, I plugged in the Dahua's and they worked very well. I threw a spare 2Tb drive in the UDMpro bay and it 'just worked'. There's no alerts or motion detection but it's shown me that the system works for zero additional outlay.  


Knowing that, I've been thinking about what I really want from the system. Some cameras would just be for monitoring, like looking to see what the chickens are doing or the dogs in the garden etc, and I don't really need to record that. What would be really useful is to have recording only really start with motion detection so that I could record who comes to the door or what vehicles come down the drive.  
  
I don't need AI facial recognition or number plate recognition but if I could record a vehicle coming and going with enough detail to read a number plate if required, or have recordings of who comes to the front door, that would be great. Keeping the recording to just the motion, with the option to send me alerts when it's detected would mean a drive would only have the things I want to look at rather than hours of nothing going on.  
  
As Protect can't offer any of that with the Dahua onvif cameras I have, would something like the Ubiquiti G5 Ultra do that without any other equipment? One of those at the front door and one on the gatepost on the drive would probably give me everything I need for about £200. I could throw a larger hard drive in the UDMpro cheaply enough if needed.",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnifiProtect/comments/1m5lkqo/new_protect_user_couple_of_questions/,dahua,"""dahua camera"" OR ""dahua cctv"""

Hi, I'm getting ready to start purchasing cameras and wanted to run my thoughts past some eyes. I'd love for any feedback you may have. I've bulleted what I'm working with and then detailed the cameras I'm thinking about.  (This is a re-post from r/homesecurity.  It's not getting much traction over there and I figure this community is probably better-suited anyway.)

I appreciate any feedback!

The setup:

* All cameras will be PoE
* I want the perimeter around the house covered plus a few spots inside
* Frigate is running on a very capable Linux box (i5-13600k, 192GB memory, 14TB storage, dual Coral TPUs, dual NIC)
* I have the Home Assistant integration working with a camera already, so am confident here
* I'm focusing on Dahua cameras as they have good variety, decent quality-to-price, and are easy to set up with Frigate
   * I'm not worried about them ""phoning home"" as I'll have them all on a VLAN with no Internet access

What I'm thinking:

* For the perimeter cameras, the Dahua N85EUN2
   * 8MP with a 1/1.2"" sensor for low light performance; no IR illumination so requires ambient light
   * I have plenty of light pollution and doubt it'll be too dark for them, but I do have one coming in to set up and test to make sure. I absolutely do not want them to need their LED lights turned on to see at night when nothing of interest is happening, but I don't think this will be an issue. I likely will just disable the lights altogether.
   * I've read its image is a little fuzzy on objects within 10-ish feet, but none of these will be needed for closeup viewing.
* For the video doorbell, the Reolink Video Doorbell PoE
   * Works with Frigate and I haven't heard anything bad about it
* For the few spots inside I'm thinking the Dahua N85FL7Z
   * The focus with these is keeping track of stuff during the day (anyone with young kids understands). Night time clarity isn't a priority.
   * 8MP with a 1/1.8"" sensor and IR illumination
   * These will all be in a corner, so only need to cover a 90deg FOV.
* What's your opinion on a garage camera? I'd mainly use it for motion detection and turning on/off the lights. I have an IR-based motion sensor that just does not like temperature gradients or hot weather (surprise, surprise it gets hot in a garage).",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/frigate_nvr/comments/1lk6oyh/planning_my_setup_looking_for_feedback_on_the/,dahua,"""dahua camera"" OR ""dahua cctv"""

Hello. I installed 5 Dahua cameras on my house. 2x IPC-HFW1530S-0280B-S6 and 3x DH-IPC-HFW1530S-S6 and recently with DHI-NVR4108HS-4KS2/L. 2 tb storage WD purple.

Mostly using DMSS. Live playback from every camera on highest quality is perfect. The 1st two support push notifications of video motion detection directly to DMSS. It turned out that other 3 (thought it's the same, same seller, but turned out to be worse vid quality and no push notif) can support push notifications and alarms through the NVR. I anyway had a plan to buy the nvr so was not a big deal. I managed to get push notifications from those cameras also.

I noticed that it is barely possible to view live through nvr. On HD (I believe it's the main stream) often doesn't even load, says timeout. When switching to SD it's ok, little delay but acceptable. I know it has to process camera-&gt;nvr-&gt;dmss so there will or could be some little delays.

My general goal was to set all 5 cameras to record videos in the highest possible quality only on events. I don't neet 24/7 recording. So I set recording schedules accordingly disabling general full time recording.

I thought that it would be a 'relief' for the cameras so that nvr live view would be possible on HD, but did not change. Therefore it is not my main concern. Also, they playback of recorded videos is barely accessible through DMSS. Often not loading, or speeding up/glitching - not constant. Skipping on the timeline of the video also reloads for next 5 seconds. It is just not as fluent as I would expect. I have random xiaomi wifi camera with sd card inside, and compared to Dahua it works like a charm. Quick access to videos and fast swiping through them.

My isp is 200 download 50 upload.

They installed a DMSS app on my phone for operating the cameras. 

And I have some issues:

1) When there’s motion detection, I can’t see the next 7 minutes of recording. For example, I got an alert that there was motion detected at 09:00 AM, I go to see the recording, drag the timeline to 09:00 AM where the event occurred, and it plays perfectly fine before the time stamp, and then when it hits 09:00 it skips 7 minutes and 20 seconds, straight to 09:07:20, and every time I try to drag the timeline back it keeps skipping to 09:07:20. 

2) Notifications “device offline”. It happens 5-15 times a day on its own, but more often it happens when I open the DMSS app. I stays offline for 10-15 seconds and then it’s back to normal. Sometimes it can happen few times in a row. The internet it’s connected to is a 5G router connected tho the NVR with ethernet cable. The speed on average is 300-700 mbps, so I don’t think internet speed is the issue, especially if that happens mostly after I open the DMSS app.

I saw a guide to using Jeedom with Ajax Systems and controlling it in HA using MQTT.

I’ve set up Jeedom and can see the Ajax System.

I set up MQTT manager on Jeedom and set it up as a remote broker with my HA login details, as per the guide.

I am stuck on what to do with the HA MQTT side of things. Can anyone give me some guidance on this? I check the HA broker logs and there was a connection from my Jeedom.

I also saw in the guide some yaml code for getting sensors but I have no idea where the data would show up in HA and the when I check the yaml configuration file with the code for a sensor it says that it cannot find the integration.

Help would be very much appreciated.

Thinking either to get Ajax outdoor cameras or the Ubiquiti ones. We’d get the doorbell and CCTV from one of the systems.

Okay so ive been doing this thing where I feed the crows around town any time I see them and they've started recognizing me and coming up to me and stuff sometimes, they also sometimes follow our work trucks around and in the last week ive noticed in the mornings I hear them right outside my window and I assumed they followed me home but then today I noticed they ONLY are loud right around the time my alarms goes off then they fly away or get quiet so like???? Have they heard my alarm and figured out whay time I wake up and have been waking me up??? I know crows are super intelligent but that also seems insane? Are they smart enough to do that or is it just a coincidence?

Middle of the day, sitting in home office as usual. Start hearing a loud, unusually loud crow gathering. I normally have 3-9 on the regular but this sounded like 100 crows.

I look out the window and don't see anything unusual so I go out the front door to take a look.

I take three steps out the door (looking up at the trees) and then look out at the yard and there is a bobcat! Probably five feet away. 

I immediately back up and return inside. Watch the crows chase that sucker off my yard and down the street. 

I love them so much.

reddit,1l8xtmr,1l8xtmr,royalgoldhouse,2025-06-11T18:55:38,"Befriending my block’s crows. Where do you guys think I should go from here?
There’s probably two crows that visit my house daily that I’ve been trying to win over for the last week or so (it’s usually one crow here, the most I’ve seen here are two at once). At first, I spread dog kibble at my driveway entrance for several days just so it’ll see my house as a reliable food source. I’d like to think that I succeeded because, like I said, I see a crow strutting through my yard every morning between 7-8. 

In my pursuits, I’ve also managed to attract a flock of grackles to a tree behind my house, that swarm the dog food that I leave, right after I go back inside. They annoyed me at first, because they scarf down the kibble before a crow can fly by, notice, and get to it some of the time, but what I’ve also noticed is that because crows and grackles don’t get along, the grackles make a certain “*chk*” sound whenever a crow is around, which serves as kind of a crow alarm to me. The crow usually doesn’t give a shit about the grackles, even when they swoop down on it, but once it eats and flies away, there’s 2 or 3 grackles that chase it away from my house. 

So, right before I started typing this post, I was chilling in my bed when they started making the sound again, and voila, I look out the window and see a crow in my backyard. I do my whistle-and-three-clicks call and throw a few peanuts out the window into the crows line of sight, it comes by scoops one up, and flies into the street to eat it. What I used to do was walk outside towards my garage to throw some out so I could make sure it would see me, but most of the time it’d get spooked and fly to some trees several houses away from mine. I’d say over the last 3 days, whenever it comes by and sees me throw food out of the window, it’ll pick it up and fly away, but I want to make sure it associates *me* with the food and not just my house, so I always keep my head hanging outside of the window looking like an idiot to my neighbors while it cracks open and eats the peanuts. I look off to the side as well so it doesn’t feel threatened. As I’m typing this now, it just came back for seconds. 

Two days ago, my mom came over and while we were outside talking near my garage (where I leave the food) a crow flew to the utility pole right above us watching us. Yesterday, I was cutting grass and happened to look up and see a crow far, far into the distance on a tree possibly watching me. What I wanna know, is do you guys think I need to make myself more visible so it could watch me more and get comfortable with seeing me around, or is the crow seeing me throw food out of the window enough for me to earn its trust?",14,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/crowbro/comments/1l8xtmr/befriending_my_blocks_crows_where_do_you_guys/,crow,"""crow alarm"" OR ""crow security"" -""crowdfunding"" -""crowd"" -""bird"""
reddit,1jdmy1a,1jdmy1a,mazdadriver14,2025-03-17T21:30:40,"Ressie Roundup - Round 2
It’s kinda in the title. 

In case you missed it last week, this is a weekly thread looking at the ins, outs and happenings of footy that *aren’t* the AFL or AFLW’s top leagues. 

If you’re keen to discuss anything that happens in footy - from the league’s reserve competitions to your hyper local footy leagues - we’re hoping to cultivate and support this. And as someone myself who knows embarrassingly little about the sport’s lower leagues, this is my learning opportunity, too. 

We’re still a few weeks away from SA and WA joining the party, but the VFL kicks off this Saturday - and you’ll be able to watch it on [FTA, with 7 promising a Saturday night VFL match every week of the season](https://www.afl.com.au/news/1281872/saturday-night-lights-to-shine-on-vfl). You’ll be able to catch them on 7Mate if you’re Victorian, or 7Plus Sport elsewhere in the country from 7pm. 

Not a sponsored post for 7 to clarify (I’m not Ben Roberts Smith) but it does lend the question - **would you want to see match threads on r/afl for the Saturday night VFL clashes?**

In other news around the reserve’s landscape: 

* North Melbourne and Werribee announced [a partnership in the VFLW](https://www.afl.com.au/news/1278609/north-melbourne-partners-with-werribee-across-vflw-and-nga-programs), with North’s team now to be known as the North Melbourne Werribee Kangaroos.
* The SANFL’s women’s league got underway, with [Central Districts, Woodville-West Torrens, West Adelaide and South Adelaide all securing wins](https://sanfl.com.au/league/news/round-1-hostplus-sanflw-match-wraps/). 
* Mirroring their AFL level sides, the Crows secured a win over South Adelaide and the Port lost to Norwood in their [respective SANFL trial matches](https://sanfl.com.au/league/news/2025-hostplus-sanfl-league-trial-matches/)over the weekend (last year’s premiers, Glenelg, won their two trials).
* The [WAFL celebrated their oldest surviving player, with Bob Taylor turning 100.](https://wafootball.com.au/news/26000/wa-football-congratulates-centurion?\_\_hstc=11717099.708fb82fd38d7e0c7ac81cfa4f5f5f06.1742208187979.1742208187979.1742208187979.1&amp;\_\_hssc=11717099.1.1742208187979&amp;\_\_hsfp=176216439&amp;\_gl=1\*8m9veu\*\_ga\*MTg1ODQzMTY5MS4xNzM5OTY0Nzcz\*\_ga\_R8JX9ZR7KV\*MTc0MjIwODE4Ny4yLjAuMTc0MjIwODE4Ny42MC4wLjExOTIwMzM1ODM[.](https://wafootball.com.au/news/26000/wa-football-congratulates-centurion?__hstc=11717099.708fb82fd38d7e0c7ac81cfa4f5f5f06.1742208187979.1742208187979.1742208187979.1&amp;__hssc=11717099.1.1742208187979&amp;__hsfp=176216439&amp;_gl=1*8m9veu*_ga*MTg1ODQzMTY5MS4xNzM5OTY0Nzcz*_ga_R8JX9ZR7KV*MTc0MjIwODE4Ny4yLjAuMTc0MjIwODE4Ny42MC4wLjExOTIwMzM1ODM.)) Bob played for East Perth, went to war during WW2 and then came back to represent the Perth Football Club. What an innings. 
* Sponsorship news, because this is important, apparently: [Bunnings is now a sponsor of the VFL](https://www.afl.com.au/news/1277993/vfl-and-bunnings-build-new-partnership), as the “official completion partner”, while (in slightly old news), the WAFL will now be known as the [Sullivan Logistics WAFL](https://wafootball.com.au/news/25894/wafl-secures-naming-rights-sponsor?\_\_hstc=11717099.708fb82fd38d7e0c7ac81cfa4f5f5f06.1742208187979.1742208187979.1742208187979.1&amp;\_\_hssc=11717099.1.1742208187979&amp;\_\_hsfp=176216439&amp;\_gl=1\*1sb6d45\*\_ga\*MTg1ODQzMTY5MS4xNzM5OTY0Nzcz\*\_ga\_R8JX9ZR7KV\*MTc0MjIwODE4Ny4yLjAuMTc0MjIwODE4Ny42MC4wLjExOTIwMzM1ODM) after finding a new naming rights partner.
